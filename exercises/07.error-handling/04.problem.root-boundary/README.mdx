# Root ErrorBoundary

üë®‚Äçüíº We don't currently have an `ErrorBoundary` component for our root route. This
is a problem for two reasons:

1. If we add more routes and they don't have an `ErrorBoundary`, those errors have
   nowhere to bubble up to.
2. If there's an error in our root route, we don't have a way to catch it.

So we need you to export an `ErrorBoundary` from the root route. But it's not
quite that simple like the other routes... You'll see in a bit.

First, add a simple `ErrorBoundary` to the root route. Then uncomment one of
Kody's errors in the component or the loader. You'll notice that when you
refresh the page, none of the styles appear. If you look at the source of the
HTML, you'll see something like this:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<div
	class="container mx-auto flex h-full w-full items-center justify-center rounded-xl bg-destructive p-20 text-h2 text-destructive-foreground"
>
	<p>üê® root loader error</p>
</div>
```

What happened to our... well... everything? Why is it just the contents of our
error boundary?

Well, remember that our root component is responsible for rendering everything
between the `<html>` and `</html>`. So if there's an error rendering that, then
we won't have any of that stuff in our HTML. All we get is what's rendered in
the `ErrorBoundary`.

So we're going to need to make sure our error boundary renders the basic
"Document" stuff we need for our HTML document.

We'll do this by turning lots of what's in our `App` component into a `Document`
component that can be used by both the `App` and the `ErrorBoundary`.

So when you're all done, it should look something like this:

```tsx filename=app/root.tsx
export default function App() {
	return <Document>{/* app stuff */}</Document>
}

export function ErrorBoundary() {
	return <Document>{/* error stuff */}</Document>
}
```
