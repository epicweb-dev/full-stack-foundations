# Error Abstraction

👨‍💼 To keep things consistent, Kellie (🧝‍♂️) has made a handy abstraction for error
boundaries. You can find it in <InlineFile file="app/components/error-boundary.tsx" />.
Here's how you use it:

```tsx
export function ErrorBoundary() {
	return (
		<GeneralErrorBoundary
			statusHandlers={{
				403: ({ params }) => (
					<p>You're not authorized to look at {params.sandwichId}</p>
				),
			}}
		/>
	)
}
```

You can specify any status code you want, and the error boundary will render
whatever you return in your callback.

We'd like you to update the `ErrorBoundary` you've got already to use this,
and now we can add it to several of the `/users/:userId/notes` routes as well.
