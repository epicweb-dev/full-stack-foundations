# Handle Route Errors

<EpicVideo url="https://www.epicweb.dev/workshops/full-stack-foundations/error-handling/improving-error-handling-and-ui-on-user-profile-page" />

👨‍💼 If you open <InlineFile file="app/routes/users+/$username.tsx" /> and
uncomment one of the errors Kody 🐨 added for you,
then try loading <LinkToApp to="/users/kody" />, you'll notice the error
looks pretty bad. We definitely want to customize that!

Could you please add an `ErrorBoundary` component
to <InlineFile file="app/routes/users+/$username.tsx" /> so we can handle
errors that happen there in our app?

Please make sure to log the error in the console with `console.error` so we can
see what's going on in our debugging.

As a reminder, here's an example of what an error boundary looks like:

```tsx filename=app/routes/errors-oh-no.tsx
import { useRouteError } from '@remix-run/react'

export function ErrorBoundary() {
	const error = useRouteError()
	console.error(error)

	return (
		<div>
			<h1>Oh no!</h1>
			<p>Something bad happened! Sorry!</p>
		</div>
	)
}
```
