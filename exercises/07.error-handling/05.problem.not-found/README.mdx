# Not Found

<EpicVideo url="https://www.epicweb.dev/workshops/full-stack-foundations/error-handling/handling-404-errors-in-react-router-with-splat-routes" />

👨‍💼 Right now if you go to a route that doesn't exist (like `/does/not/exist`),
our root route's error boundary will handle that. Unfortunately, this error
boundary is pretty limited because we can't rely on the root route's loader for
any data. This makes our 404 page pretty useless.

To be clear, we do have a 404 page for notes and users that aren't found. So
going to `/users/does-not-exist` works well. And also
`/users/kody/notes/does-not-exist` works well too. We just want to do the same
for routes that don't exist at all. Like `/does-not-exist` or
`/users/kody/does-not-exist`.

So we're going to use a router feature called a "splat route" to handle this.
A splat route effectively says "match any route that starts with this path". So
we can create a splat route at the end of our router that matches any route that
starts with `/` and because splat routes receive a lower priority than others,
we'll know if the splat route gets rendered it's because no other route matched
so we can show our 404 error.

<callout-info>
	It's important to note that splat routes aren't only useful for 404s, but they
	can be really handy for use with a CMS where the URL segments are dynamic.
</callout-info>

As we're following the `remix-flat-routes` convention, to create a route that
matches `/*`, 🐨 we'll create a file at <InlineFile file="app/routes/$.tsx" />.

With that file created, you need to 🐨 create a loader that throws a `404`
response:

```tsx
export async function loader() {
	throw new Response('Not found', { status: 404 })
}
```

Next, let's 🐨 export the `ErrorBoundary`:

```tsx
import { Link, useLocation } from '@remix-run/react'
import { GeneralErrorBoundary } from '../components/error-boundary.tsx'

// ...

export function ErrorBoundary() {
	const location = useLocation()
	return (
		<GeneralErrorBoundary
			statusHandlers={{
				404: () => (
					<div className="flex flex-col gap-6">
						<div className="flex flex-col gap-3">
							<h1>We can't find this page:</h1>
							<pre className="text-body-lg whitespace-pre-wrap break-all">
								{location.pathname}
							</pre>
						</div>
						<Link to="/" className="text-body-md underline">
							Back to home
						</Link>
					</div>
				),
			}}
		/>
	)
}
```

Finally, you'll want to 🐨 export a default export so Remix treats this route as
a regular page (otherwise it'll be treated as a
[Resource Route](https://remix.run/docs/en/main/guides/resource-routes)):

```tsx
// ...

export default function NotFound() {
	// due to the loader, this component will never be rendered, but we'll return
	// the error boundary just in case.
	return <ErrorBoundary />
}

// ...
```

And with that, you should now be able to go to any route that doesn't exist and
you should still see the header and footer. This will make it a much better user
experience when folks hit a page that doesn't exist.
