# Links to Public Files

<EpicVideo url="https://www.epicweb.dev/workshops/full-stack-foundations/styling/manage-asset-links-in-a-remix-application" />

👨‍💼 We're super excited about this awesome new app! First off, we've got an
awesome favicon for our site in the `public` directory. Browsers will request
the `/favicon.ico` by default, but we've got a
✨ responsive ✨ <InlineFile file="public/favicon.svg" /> that will look good in
light and dark mode (you find a media query embedded in the SVG itself). Let's
get that on the page.

To do this, we'll need to add a `<link>` to <InlineFile file="app/root.tsx" />.

In Remix, you add links to the page by exporting a `links` function:

```tsx filename=app/root.tsx
// ...
import { type LinksFunction } from '@remix-run/node'

export const links: LinksFunction = () => {
	return [
		{
			rel: 'stylesheet',
			// all files in the public directory are served at the root of the site
			href: '/my-stylesheet.css',
		},
	]
}

//...
```

It's important for you to know that Remix puts all the responsibility of what
appears in the document on you. The `app/root.tsx` component you export is
responsible for everything that appears between `<html>` and `</html>` and that
includes the `<head>` element which contains the links that routes define. So
you need to render the
[`<Links />`](https://remix.run/docs/en/main/components/links) element in that
component:

```tsx filename=app/root.tsx lines=10
// ...
import { Links } from '@remix-run/react'

// ...

export default function App() {
	return (
		<html>
			<head>
				<Links />
			</head>
			{/* ... */}
		</html>
	)
}
```

> 🦉 Remember, check the `Files` section at the bottom of these instructions for
> links that will open your editor to the right file you need to alter. My other
> emoji friends will be waiting there for you to guide you through this task.

🦉 Tip: Check the network tab in the app on the home page. You'll know you got
it right when you see the `favicon.svg` file loaded.
