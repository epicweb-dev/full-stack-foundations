🧝‍♂️ Did I getcha!? 😂🤣

👨‍💼 Great work, now we can easily add bundled CSS for our apps. This applies not
only to CSS from component libraries that we import, but also to our own CSS
components. Additionally, Remix has built-in support for
[CSS Modules](https://github.com/css-modules/css-modules) and
[Vanilla Extract](https://vanilla-extract.style/) the CSS of which will also
appear in the bundle. So, included in the CSS bundle will be:

- [CSS Modules](https://remix.run/docs/en/main/guides/styling#css-modules)
- [Vanilla Extract](https://remix.run/docs/en/main/guides/styling#vanilla-extract)
- [Side-effect CSS imports](https://remix.run/docs/en/main/guides/styling#css-side-effect-imports)

🧝‍♂️ I'm going to make a couple changes to make the homepage look nicer. Feel free
to <DiffLink>check the diff</DiffLink> if you'd like!
