🧝‍♂️ Did I getcha!? 😂🤣

👨‍💼 Great work, now we can easily add bundled CSS for our apps. This applies not
only to CSS from component libraries that we import, but also to our own CSS
components. Additionally, Remix has built-in support for
[CSS Modules](https://github.com/css-modules/css-modules) and
[Vanilla Extract](https://vanilla-extract.style/) the CSS of which will also
appear in the bundle. So, included in the CSS bundle will be:

- [CSS Modules](https://remix.run/docs/en/main/guides/styling#css-modules)
- [Vanilla Extract](https://remix.run/docs/en/main/guides/styling#vanilla-extract)
- [Side-effect CSS imports](https://remix.run/docs/en/main/guides/styling#css-side-effect-imports)

🧝‍♂️ I'm going to make a couple changes to make the homepage look nicer. Feel free

🦺 When you use Array.filter(Boolean) in your own code, you might notice a
different behavior, from what you've just seen in the solution. Typescript is
still yelling at you 😮. That's because Typescript doesn’t play well with
Array.filter(Boolean). To tackle this problem we use
[Matt Pocock's handy library ts-reset](https://www.totaltypescript.com/ts-reset).

🦉 If you're curious about why we don't just use the bundle solution for all our
CSS files (like tailwind and the fonts), watch this tip from Kent:
