👨‍💼 Super! Now if you check out the network tab, you'll notice the SVG that is
loaded for our favicon has a special "hash" in the URL which serves as a
fingerprint of the file's contents. If you change the contents of the SVG (like
add a comment), then the fingerprint changes and the browser will download the
new file.

All without us having to worry about it. So now our caching can be as aggressive
as we want it to be, and we don't have to worry about users getting stale
content.
