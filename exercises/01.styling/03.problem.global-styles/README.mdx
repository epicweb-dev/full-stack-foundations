# Global Styles

<EpicVideo url="https://www.epicweb.dev/workshops/full-stack-foundations/styling/add-custom-fonts-to-the-global-css" />

👨‍💼 Every application has _some_ stylesheets that need to apply globally
throughout the application. In our case, we want to have a special font applied
to our app which your co-worker Kellie (🧝‍♀️ hello there 👋) placed in the
`public` directory.

🧝‍♂️ Yep, I also added <InlineFile file="app/styles/font.css" /> which loads the
font and gets things ready for use.

👨‍💼 Thanks Kellie! So, what we need you to do is import that stylesheet into the
application so that it is applied globally. It'll be pretty similar to the
favicon work you've already done, but you'll use `rel="stylesheet"`. When you're
done, the `<link>` should be something like:
`<link rel="stylesheet" href="/build/_assets/font-SBXW2PKK.css"/>`.
