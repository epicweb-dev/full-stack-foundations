# Server Validation

👨‍💼 Sadly, browser only validation is not enough. User's can easily change the
DOM using the browser devtools or even POST to our server directly. You _always_
must validate on the server side. And you'll also want to render the errors from
the server.

The `action` can do some validation, whatever validation it likes (even `async`
validation), and if there are errors it can send them back in a JSON response.
You get what the `action` returns using a hook called `useActionData` which is
very similar to `useLoaderData` with the exception that it will return
`undefined` until the `action` has been called. Here's an example of that:

```tsx filename=app/routes/subscribe.tsx lines=2,4-9,15-36,44,46-47,54-60
import { json, redirect, type DataFunctionArgs } from '@remix-run/node'
import { useActionData } from '@remix-run/react'

type ActionErrors = {
	formErrors: Array<string>
	fieldErrors: {
		email: Array<string>
	}
}

export async function action({ request }: DataFunctionArgs) {
	const formData = await request.formData()
	const email = formData.get('email')

	const errors: ActionErrors = {
		formErrors: [],
		fieldErrors: {
			email: [],
		},
	}
	if (email.length < 3 && !email.includes('@')) {
		errors.fieldErrors.email.push('Invalid email')
	}
	const hasErrors =
		errors.formErrors.length ||
		Object.values(errors.fieldErrors).some(fieldErrors => fieldErrors.length)
	if (hasErrors) {
		return json(
			{
				status: 'error',
				errors,
				// 🦺 the as const is here to help with our TypeScript inference
			} as const,
			{ status: 400 },
		)
	}

	// subscribe the user to the newsletter

	return redirect('/success')
}

export default function Subscribe() {
	const actionData = useActionData<typeof action>()

	const fieldErrors =
		actionData?.status === 'error' ? actionData.errors.fieldErrors : null
	const formErrors =
		actionData?.status === 'error' ? actionData.errors.formErrors : null

	return (
		<Form method="post">
			<label>
				Email <input required type="email" />
			</label>
			{fieldErrors?.email?.length ? (
				<ul>
					{fieldErrors.email.map(e => (
						<li key={e}>{e}</li>
					))}
				</ul>
			) : null}
			<button type="submit">Subscribe</button>
		</Form>
	)
}
```

The structure of the `action` response is up to you, but I recommend you use the
structure I have laid out above as it handles multiple errors per field and
form-wide errors with the `formErrors`.

Keep in mind that because `useActionData` returns the `action` data, it could be
undefined until the form has been submitted.

To help you out a bit, you can even use this component if you'd like:

```tsx
function ErrorList({ errors }: { errors?: Array<string> | null }) {
	return errors?.length ? (
		<ul className="flex flex-col gap-1">
			{errors.map((error, i) => (
				<li key={i} className="text-foreground-danger text-[10px]">
					{error}
				</li>
			))}
		</ul>
	) : null
}
```

This will make it easy to just render a list of errors, and you can give it a
little space too like this:

```tsx
<div className="min-h-[32px] px-4 pb-3 pt-1">
	<ErrorList errors={fieldErrors?.email} />
</div>
```

Doing things this way will reduce the amount of jumpiness in the UI when the
errors load which is a nicer UX.

<callout-info class="aside">
	You could definitely put that `div` in the `ErrorList` component, but I prefer
	to limit the amount of spacing styles that are external to the component
	itself. Otherwise you'll find yourself needing to customize this in other
	places.
</callout-info>

🐨 Please add some server-side validation to the `action` function and display
any errors returned from that in the form.

<callout-danger>
	To test out the server validation, you'll need to temporarily disable the form
	validation. This is easily done by adding a `noValidate` attribute on the
	form. We'll improve this next.
