# Search Engine Optimization

<EpicVideo url="https://www.epicweb.dev/workshops/full-stack-foundations/search-engine-optimization/intro-to-search-engine-optimization-seo" />

When it comes to finding things on the web, almost everyone does so using a
search engine. There's a growing diversity of search engines, but still Google
is the king ðŸ‘‘. Helping search engines like Google to properly categorize your
content is called Search Engine Optimization (SEO). It's a very broad topic, and
we're not going to cover the specifics of everything here. Our primary goal is
to help you understand how to properly use metadata tags (like `meta` and
`title`) to help search engines categorize your content.

Lots of what applies to search engines also applies to other tools and social
media platforms as well. So it's a good idea to spend some time thinking about
your website's sources of traffic and learning how to optimize your website's
presentation on those platforms.

## The web

The `<title>` tag appears in the `<head>` and is typically what is displayed in
the browser tab. It's also what is displayed in search engine results.

```html lines=3
<html>
	<head>
		<title>My Page</title>
	</head>
	<body>
		<!-- ... -->
	</body>
</html>
```

The `<meta>` tag is used to provide metadata about the page. It's typically used
to provide information about the page to search engines. The `name` attribute is
used to specify the type of metadata, and the `content` attribute is used to
provide the actual metadata.

The `description` metadata is used to provide a short description of the page
and is often used in search engine results as well as social media preview
cards.

```html lines=4
<html>
	<head>
		<title>My Page</title>
		<meta name="description" content="This is my page" />
	</head>
	<body>
		<!-- ... -->
	</body>
</html>
```

Meta tags aren't only for search engines. They can also be used to provide
configuration information to other tools. For example, the `viewport` metadata
is used to configure the viewport of a mobile browser.

```html lines=5
<html>
	<head>
		<title>My Page</title>
		<meta name="description" content="This is my page" />
		<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1" />
	</head>
	<body>
		<!-- ... -->
	</body>
</html>
```

What this does is tell the browser to set the width of the viewport to the width
of the device, and to set the initial zoom level to 1. This is a common
configuration for mobile browsers.

A final example is the `charset` metadata. This is used to specify the character
encoding of the page.

```html lines=6
<html>
	<head>
		<title>My Page</title>
		<meta name="description" content="This is my page" />
		<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1" />
		<meta charset="utf-8" />
	</head>
	<body>
		<!-- ... -->
	</body>
</html>
```

This is pretty much always how you'd want to configure charset, unless you're
doing something funky with character encodings.

There are many other types of metadata that can be provided, but we'll leave
that as an exercise for the reader (you can
[learn more about meta tags on seosherpa.com](https://seosherpa.com/meta-tags/)).

## In Remix

Because you're responsible for everything between the `<html>` and `</html>` in
your document, adding metadata tags is as simple as adding them to your JSX.

```tsx filename=app/root.tsx
export default function App() {
	return (
		<html>
			<head>
				<title>My Page</title>
				<meta name="description" content="This is my page" />
				<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1" />
				<meta charset="utf-8" />
			</head>
			<body>{/* ... */}</body>
		</html>
	)
}
```

However, things can get tricky when we start thinking about nested routes and
having that title and description be dynamic based on the current route. That's
why Remix has a built-in API for routes defining the `meta` tags that should be
used when the route is active through
[the route `meta` export](https://remix.run/docs/en/main/route/meta). It's
similar in some ways to the `links` export, but instead, when a route defines a
`meta` export, the `meta` tags from ancestor routes are ignored and must be
manually merged. This avoids conflicts between routes that might have the same
`meta` tags. However, you do have access to the parent metas in the `meta`
function so you can merge them yourself if you so desire.

```tsx filename=app/routes/sandwiches.tsx
import { type MetaFunction } from '@remix-run/react'

export const meta: MetaFunction = () => {
	return [
		{ title: 'Sandwich Shop' },
		{ name: 'description', content: 'Fill your tummy with something yummy' },
	]
}
```

Again, in Remix you're responsible for everything on the page between `<html>`
and `</html>` and that's no different here. You need to apply the
[`<Meta />`](https://remix.run/docs/en/main/components/meta) component in the
`<head>` of your document in your `app/root.tsx` to ensure these meta tags are
rendered. Much like the `<Links />` component.

With that example above, the `<head>` of your document have this:

```html
<title>Sandwich Shop</title>
<meta charset="utf-8" />
<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width,initial-scale=1" />
<meta name="description" content="Fill your tummy with something yummy" />
```

You can also access dynamic data (data from your `loader`) in the `meta` export
so you can dynamically set the title, description, `og:image`, etc for your
page.

```tsx filename=app/routes/sandwiches.$sandwichId.tsx
import { json } from '@remix-run/node'
import { type MetaFunction } from '@remix-run/react'
import { getSandwich } from '../sandwiches.server'

export const meta: MetaFunction<typeof loader> = ({ data }) => {
	return [
		{ title: data.sandwich.name },
		{ name: 'description', content: data.sandwich.description },
	]
}

export function loader({ params }) {
	return json({ sandwich: getSandwich(params.sandwichId) })
}
```
