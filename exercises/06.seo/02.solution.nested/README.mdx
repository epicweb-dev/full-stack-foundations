# Meta Overrides

üë®‚Äçüíº Great! Now we can customize the meta tags on our routes! Let's do a bit more
for our profile pages.

ü¶â You'll notice that if you navigate to the `/users/kody` route, you'll see the
`Profile | Epic Notes` in the title, which is expected. But if you navigate to a
child path, like `/users/kody/notes`, you'll see only `Epic Notes` again. It may
look like this is an unexpected behavior as we might be expecting the children
paths to inherit the parent's meta overrides.

## Use case: `/users/kody` and `/users/kody/notes`

Let's focus on `/users/kody` and `/users/kody/notes` URL paths case for a while:
regardless they have a parent-child relationship in terms of their paths, they
_do not_ have the same relationship in the REMIX's layout hierarchy. This is
how our pages are organized in terms of files inside of the `routes` directory:

```
/users/kody 			<=> routes/users+/$username.tsx
/users/kody/notes <=> routes/users+/$username_+/notes.tsx
```

That little underscore in the name of the folder `$username_+` means that the
pages inside of it don't use the layout defined in the
`routes/users+/$username.tsx` file (and consequently, they won't use the meta
override defined over there). In other words: they aren't "layout-nested", even
when _they are_ "url-nested". In summary:

- In terms of URL path: `/users/kody/notes` _is_ a child of `/users/kody`
- In terms of layout: `/users/kody/notes` _is not_ a child of `/users/kody`

The page in `/users/kody/notes` will, in fact, use the meta override from the
first route module hierarchically above `routes/users+/$username.tsx`, which is
the override we defined in the `root.tsx`. You can always have a better view of
the layout-nesting by running `npx remix routes` in a terminal at the root of a
remix project. Doing that you should get something like this:

{/* prettier-ignore */}
```tsx
<Routes>
	<Route file="root.tsx">
		<Route index file="routes/index.tsx" />
		<Route path="resources/healthcheck" file="routes/resources+/healthcheck.tsx" />
		<Route path="users/:username" file="routes/users+/$username.tsx" />
		<Route path="users/:username/notes" file="routes/users+/$username_+/notes.tsx">
			<Route path=":noteId" file="routes/users+/$username_+/notes.$noteId.tsx" />
			<Route path=":noteId/edit" file="routes/users+/$username_+/notes.$noteId_.edit.tsx" />
			<Route index file="routes/users+/$username_+/notes.index.tsx" />
		</Route>
	</Route>
</Routes>
```
