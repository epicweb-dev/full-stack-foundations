# Meta Overrides

👨‍💼 Great! Now we can customize the meta tags on our routes! Let's do a bit more
for our profile pages.

<callout-info>
	🦉 You'll notice that if you navigate to the `/users/kody` route, you'll see
	the `Profile | Epic Notes` in the title. But you'll see only `Epic Notes`
	when you navigate to one of its child URLs, like `/users/kody/notes`. It
	behaves like that because, regardless the 2 URLs have a parent-child
	relationship, in terms of layout, `/users/kody/notes` is not a child of 
	`/users/kody`. Remember that the latter folder path is defined like this:
	`routes/users+/$username.tsx` while the former's path is
	`routes/users+/$username_+/notes.tsx`. That little underscore in the name of
	the folder `$username_+` means that the pages inside will skip using the
	layout defined in the `routes/users+/$username.tsx` file. In other words,
	they won't be "layout-nested", even if they will be "url-nested". And, because
	they won't be layout-nested, they won't inherit the meta override defined
	in the `routes/users+/$username.tsx`, following, instead, the meta override
	defined in the `routes/root.tsx` which is its parent regarding layout. One way
	of seeing the layout parent-child relationships is by typing the 
	`npx remix routes` in a terminal at the root of a remix project to see how
	the routes will be configured. It should give you a better view of the
	router layout-nesting structure.
