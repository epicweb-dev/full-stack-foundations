👨‍💼 Hello, my name is Peter the Product Manager. I'm here to help you get
oriented and to give you your assignments for the day. We're going to get a new
project for note taking off the ground. We want people to write Epic Notes 💪

Today, you're going to be working on the Epic Notes app adding key features
and fixing significant bugs in a brand new application. Just as if you had been
hired to work with us today. Throughout the workshop, you'll learn important
foundational skills of web app development including:

1. Styling a Web Application
2. Utilizing the URL for Routing and Navigation
3. Loading Data from the Server and rendering it in the UI
4. Making Data mutations in a database
5. Improving our Search Engine Optimization (SEO)
6. Gracefully handling errors and displaying them to the user

It's a big job and there's lots to do, so, let's get started!
