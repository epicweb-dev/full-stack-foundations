👨‍💼 Hello, my name is Peter the Product Manager. I'm here to help you get
oriented and to give you your assignments for the day. We're going to get a new
project for note taking off the ground. We want people to write Epic Notes 💪

Today, you're going to be working on the Epic Notes app adding key features
and fixing significant bugs in an brand new application. Just as if you had been
hired to work with us today. Throughout the workshop, you'll learn important
foundational skills of web app development including:

1. Styling a Web Application
2. Utilizing the URL for Routing and Navigation
3. Loading Data from the Server and rendering it in the UI
4. Making Data mutations in a database
5. Improving our Search Engine Optimization (SEO)
6. Gracefully handling errors and displaying them to the user

It's a big job and there's lots to do, so, let's get started!
