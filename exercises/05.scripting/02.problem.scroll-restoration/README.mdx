# Scroll Restoration

<EpicVideo url="https://www.epicweb.dev/workshops/full-stack-foundations/scripting/page-navigation-with-scroll-behavior" />

👨‍💼 Now that we've got JavaScript running on the page, our customers are noticing
that their scroll position is not where they expect it to be. For example, if
you're on the notes list page and you're scrolled down a bit, then clicking the
"Edit" link leaves you where you are when it should scroll the user to the top
of the page so they can edit the note. This is because the browser is no longer
responsible for navigations, so the role of scroll restoration lies in our
hands!

Luckily, Remix has a
[📜 `ScrollRestoration`](https://remix.run/docs/en/main/components/scroll-restoration)
component we can use to fix this. Please use that component!

Once you've done that, come back here, I've got another task for you.

You got it done? Ok, great! Now I actually need you to "undo" the scroll
restoration for a particular navigation. If you're scrolled down a bit on the
list of notes, then change notes, it's jarring to have the page scroll to the
top. So for those links, we don't actually want to scroll the user to the top.
Oh what to do? 😱

Luckily, Remix allows you to control this scroll restoration behavior on a
per-link basis using the
[📜 `preventScrollReset`](https://reactrouter.com/en/main/components/link#preventscrollreset)
prop (through React Router):

```tsx
<Link preventScrollReset to="candy">
	Candy
</Link>
```

<callout-info class="aside">
	Tip: To test this out, make your browser window short so that your page is
	scrolling, then scroll to the bottom and click different notes.
</callout-info>

Go ahead and add the `preventScrollReset` prop to those links.
