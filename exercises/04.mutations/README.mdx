# Data Mutations

## The web

Ever since the invention of HTML, we've had the ability to create interactive
web applications thanks to
[the `<form>` element](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/form):

```html
<form>
	<label>
		Type:
		<input name="sandwichType" />
	</label>
	<button type="submit">Create Sandwich</button>
</form>
```

When a form is submitted on the web (like if we were to type "ham" in the
`sandwichType` input and click "Create Sandwich"), the browser will take all
associated form elements (the `sandwichType` input in our example above) and
"serialize" them into what's called a "query string" (e.g. `sandwichType=ham`)
and make a request to the server at the current URL. So, if this form appears on
the route `/sandwiches`, submitting the form will trigger a full-page refresh to
the route `/sandwiches?sandwichType=ham`.

This is great for search pages for example, but it would be really bad for a
login form (you wouldn't want someone looking over your shoulder to see your
password in the URL would you?), which is why the `<form>` element also allows
you to specify a `method` attribute to switch from the default `GET` request to
a `POST` request: `<form method="POST">`.

<callout-warning class="aside">
	Even though `GET` and `POST` are not the only methods available in HTTP, they
	are the only two methods available on HTML forms. If you try anything other
	than `POST`, the browser will just do a `GET` instead. If you'd like to learn
	more about this, watch the tip below:
</callout-warning>

<EpicVideo url="https://www.epicweb.dev/tips/only-use-get-and-post" />

When the method is `POST` the form body is submitted as a "payload" instead of a
query string. The browser will encode it as `application/x-www-form-urlencoded`.
On the server side, you can use
[the `Request`'s `formData` method](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Request/formData)
to get the form data as a `FormData` object:

```tsx
const formData = await request.formData()
const sandwichType = formData.get('sandwichType')
```

You can also change the encoding type of the form by setting the `enctype`
attribute. The only typical value for this attribute is `multipart/form-data`,
which is used for file uploads.

Sometimes the server code you want to have handle the form submission is not at
the same URL where the form appears. In this case, you can use the `action`
attribute to specify a different URL:

```html
<form action="/make-a-sandwich">
	<label>
		Type:
		<input name="sandwichType" />
	</label>
	<button type="submit">Create Sandwich</button>
</form>
```

This would make a request to `/make-a-sandwich` instead of `/sandwiches`.

### The back button

The browser submits forms with full-page refreshes, and expects to get a
response from the server that tells the browser what to do next. If the response
is HTML, then the browser will simply render that HTML. However you should _not_
do this for a successful form submission.

Have you ever seen those really annoying popups when hitting the back button
that say "Confirm Form Resubmission"? That's because the browser is trying to
resubmit the form data to the server that you submitted when you were brought to
that page the first time. This can be a major problem if the request that was
submitted was a bank transfer or an airline ticket purchase.

This is a really common problem with an extremely simple solution: **don't
respond with HTML for successful form submissions**. Instead, respond with a
redirect (using the `Location` header and a 302 or 303 status code). This is commonly
referred to as "Post/Redirect/Get" (PRG) pattern.

### Revalidation

Because this is a full-page refresh, the HTML the server sends back to the user
will always have the latest data. This is awesome because it means you don't
really need to worry about state management. The database can be the source of
truth. So with the foundational web primitives we have, web apps will always
have fresh data as the user navigates with links and submits forms.

Unfortunately, that's not the default situation if you try to update data with
JavaScript (which you can do with the `fetch` API). You would do this if you
don't want a full-page refresh when the user submits a form, which is the user
experience that our users expect from modern web applications. This drastically
complicates things because now we have to worry about state management in the
client to keep the UI up-to-date. But it's worth the work. Can you imagine every
time you like a tweet you get a full-page refresh? What a disaster _that_ would
be!

This can be a real challenge... Unless you're using a
[Progressively Enhanced Single Page App](https://kcd.im/pespa) framework like
Remix ðŸ˜‰

## In Remix

Remix has mutation capabilities built-in the framework and it's entirely based
on the browser behavior for `<form>`s. Remix is a "browser emulator" which
simply means it prevents the full-page refresh, but still makes it so you don't
have to worry about revalidation because Remix will revalidate all your data
when the form submission is successful.

The API for mutations in your UI code is _just_ like a regular `<form>`, except
you use
[Remix's `<Form>` component](https://remix.run/docs/en/main/components/form).

Because Remix is a full-stack application framework, it also has a server-side
API for handling the form's submission. It looks very similar to the `loader`
API. In your route module, you export
[an async `action` function](https://remix.run/docs/en/main/route/action) and
receive the `request` and `params`, and you're expected to return a `Response`
(remember, if the form submission is successful, you should return a redirect):

```tsx filename=app/routes/sandwiches.chooser.tsx
import { Form } from '@remix-run/react'
import { type DataFunctionArgs, redirect } from '@remix-run/node'

export async function action({ request, params }: DataFunctionArgs) {
	const formData = await request.formData()
	const sandwichType = formData.get('sandwichType')

	// do something with the sandwichType

	return redirect('/sandwiches')
}

export default function SandwichChooser() {
	return (
		<Form method="POST">
			<label>
				Type: <input name="sandwichType" />
			</label>
			<button type="submit">Create Sandwich</button>
		</Form>
	)
}
```

<callout-info class="aside">
	`action`s are called for non-GET requests, and `loaders` are called for GET
	request, so if your form does not specify a method or specifies
	`method="GET"`, then your loader will be called instead of the action.
</callout-info>

Again, once your form has been submitted, Remix will revalidate all your data so
you don't have to worry about state management in the client.

<callout-info class="aside">
	It's important to know that on the web and in Remix, there can only be one
	"navigational" form submission at a time. You definitely can submit multiple
	forms back-to-back, but the last one will always "win" in the event of a
	redirect.
</callout-info>

In Remix there's also a mechanism for programmatically submitting data without
user interaction (using a hook called
[`useFetcher`](https://remix.run/docs/en/main/hooks/use-fetcher)). This is a bit
more advanced than we'll get in this workshop though so we'll save it for later.
