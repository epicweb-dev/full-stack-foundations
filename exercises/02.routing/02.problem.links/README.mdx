# Links

<EpicVideo url="https://www.epicweb.dev/workshops/full-stack-foundations/routing/creating-navigation-links-for-seamless-user-experience" />

👨‍💼 Our users want to get around the application quickly. So, we're going to add
a few links in a couple places.

We want the logo in the header and footer to link to `/`.

On the <LinkToApp to="/users/kody" /> page, we want to link to the user's notes
route.

On the <LinkToApp to="/users/kody/notes" /> route, we should link back to the
`/users/kody` page. 💰 Tip, you can use a relative path (`..`), but you'll need
to learn about
[the `relative` prop](https://reactrouter.com/en/main/components/link#relative)
on the `Link` component.

<callout-warning>
	There's currently a bug with the `relative` prop on the `Link` component.
	Subscribe to updates on [this
	issue](https://github.com/remix-run/remix/issues/7896) to be notified when
	it's fixed.

On the notes route, We should also link to the `/users/kody/notes/some-note-id`
route.

The `Link` component in Remix is a wrapper around the `Link` component from
react router, so you can learn all about it in
[the react router `Link` docs](https://reactrouter.com/en/main/components/link).

As a bit of extra credit, do your best to leverage relative routes where you can
rather than hard-coding the full path of the route. This will make it easier to
move files around relative to each other in the future.

Also, look into the
[`NavLink`](https://reactrouter.com/en/main/components/nav-link) component so
you can highlight the link to the `some-note-id` route when that child route is
active. You can use the `bg-accent` class name when the link is active.

<callout-info>
	Remix is built on top of React Router, so you'll often find it beneficial to
	read the React Router docs. Remix also provides a few extra features on top of
	React Router, so you'll want to read the Remix docs as well.
