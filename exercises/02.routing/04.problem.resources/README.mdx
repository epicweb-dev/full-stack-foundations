# Resource Routes

<EpicVideo url="https://www.epicweb.dev/workshops/full-stack-foundations/routing/adding-a-resource-route" />

ü¶â So far, every HTTP request we make to our app's routes will result in UI:

- `/` - Home page
- `/users/kody` - Profile page
- `/users/kody/notes` - Notes page
- `/users/kody/notes/noteId` - Note page

But there are lots of use cases for URLs that don't return UI. For example:

- `/api/users` - Get a list of users
- `/healthcheck` - Get a report of the health of the application
- `/images/some-image-id` - Get an image

For these, the HTTP request and response is a little different from our UI
routes. Instead of the request expecting an HTML response, it expects JSON, or
plaintext, or an image. In some cases these requests could be non-GET requests
as well.

In Remix, these routes are known as
["Resource Routes"](https://remix.run/docs/en/main/guides/resource-routes) and
they are pretty simple. Here's the rule that determines whether a route is a
resource route or not:

<callout-success>
	A <strong>Resource Route</strong> is like a regular route, but it doesn't have
	a `default` export.
</callout-success>

That's it. Just don't have a default export and you're working in a resource
route.

The behavior of a resource route is what you might expect. For regular routes,
the entire nested routing structure is called and rendered to get the final
result. For resource routes, only the route that matches the request is called.
So, with a resource route, the `loader` in the `app/root.tsx` will not be run.

üë®‚Äçüíº We'd like you to create a resource route for a healthcheck for our
application. We can put this route at any URL we like (`/healthcheck`, or `/hc`,
etc.), but we're going to put it at `/resources/healthcheck`.

Our application is pretty simple, so for now, we'll keep the resource route
simple as well. We'll just return a plaintext response with the text
`"OK"`.

So create a file at<InlineFile file="app/routes/resources+/healthcheck.tsx" />,
and create a loader that returns a plaintext response with the text `"OK"`.

<summary>üí∞ The loader</summary>

If you need the extra help, here's what the loader code should look like:

```tsx
export async function loader() {
	return new Response('OK')
}
```

</details>

You'll know you got it when you go to: <LinkToApp to="/resources/healthcheck" reloadDocument />
and all you see is "OK".

<callout-warning>
	<strong>Warning</strong>: You may notice that doing a client-side navigation to
  a resource route breaks the app. This is because that route doesn't exist in
  a UI context. So you need to make sure if you link to a resource route, you
  either use a regular `<a>` or add the `reloadDocument` prop to the Link.
