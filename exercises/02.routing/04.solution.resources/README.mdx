# Resource Routes

👨‍💼 Great! Now we have a good place to put additional "health check" code that
will allow us to put in an automated check on the status of our database
connection and other things in the future.

If you'd like to see where the Epic Stack takes this eventually, check
[the healthcheck route there](https://github.com/epicweb-dev/epic-stack/blob/main/app/routes/resources%2B/healthcheck.tsx).

Additionally, if you'd like to learn more about healthcheck endpoints and how to
configure them as part of a deployment pipeline, you can watch this video from
[the Deploy Web Applications All Over the World tutorial](https://www.epicweb.dev/tutorials/deploy-web-applications):

🦉 Remember, Remix doesn't have any opinion on which routes in your folder
structure are "resource routes" and which ones aren't. So, even though we put
ours under `app/routes/resources+/`, that's not a requirement.

And you can send _any_ response you like. We're sending a plaintext response,
but you can stream audio or video, generate a PDF, generate an `og:image` for
SEO, or anything else that can be done over HTTP. You could use resource routes
to create a REST or GraphQL API. Whatever you can do with HTTP, you can do with
resource routes. (We'll get to how to handle non-GET requests soon).

Also, Remix doesn't care whether you export anything else in your resource route
either. I've taken advantage of this by exporting functions and components that
use the resource route directly in the same file. This level of colocation is
brilliant. Feel free to read more about this on
[EpicWeb.dev](https://epicweb.dev) in
["Full Stack Components"](https://www.epicweb.dev/full-stack-components).
